The init script will initiate or update the project environment.
The script will:
  * Check if the project structure is in place (created if not).
  * Update druleton submodule.
  * Set/Update configuration.
  * Install or update composer locally.
  * Install or update drush locally (if not configured to use global drush).
  * Symlink any custom command from within the config/bin to the bin directory.
    This allows you to add custom commands to the project.

Use the command hooks to add init extra requirements (eg. download extra
requirements, install nodejs packages, install packages using composer, ...).
