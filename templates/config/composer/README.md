# composer files bundles

This directory contains the Drupal composer file "bundles". A bundle file is a
Drupal composer file that groups modules, themes and libraries that provide a
specific set of functionality. E.g. a `media/composer.json` file contains all modules and
libraries to provide media support in the platform.

The `_core/composer.json` file is the only required composer file: it contains the required
Drupal version for the project.
