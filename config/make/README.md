# make files bundles

This directory contains the Drupal make file "bundles". A bundle file is a
Drupal make file that groups modules, themes and libraries that provide a
specific set of functionality. E.g. a `media.make` file contains all modules and
libraries to provide media support in the platform.

The `_core.make` file is the only required make file: it contains the required
Drupal version for the project.
