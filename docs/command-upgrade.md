# bin/upgrade command
The `bin/upgrade` command will download Core & Contributed code based on the
composer files and run the update-db command. Use this to update core and
contributed to their latest version or to apply a patch.

A backup will be taken before the reset is run.

The existing `web/sites/default` directory and its contents together with the
database will be kept.

```bash
$ bin/upgrade
```



## What does this command do?
The command will perform following script steps:

#### 1. Create a backup
A backup of a working installation will be created and stored in the `backup`
directory.

#### 2. Move web/sites/default directory to temporary location
The `web/sites/default` directory and its content is moved outside the web
directory. This because the fact that the web directory will be deleted and
replaced by running the composer files.

#### 3. Cleanup
The directories, as defined in `config/upgrade/cleanup.sh` will be deleted.

#### 4. Composer
Drupal core, contributed modules, themes and libraries will be downloaded and
unpacked in the `web` directory.

#### 5. Restore the sites/default directory from temporary location
The `sites/default` directory and its content is moved from the temporary
location back to the `web/sites/default` location.

#### 6. Upgrade drupal
The drupal upgrade script is run using the `drush -y updb` command.

#### 7. Drupal login
A browser will be opened and pointed to the URL as specified in the
[config file][link-config-config].

It will log in using the administrator account.

steps in between the reset script without having to alter (hack) the
`bin/upgrade` script as defined in druleton.
