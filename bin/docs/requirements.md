# Requirements
This skeleton requires a working bash environment. This comes standard with
Linux distributions and Mac OSX.

On top of that it requires you to have a working Apache, Mysql & PHP
environment, see [minimal requirements to run Drupal][link-drupal-requirements].

The skeleton will download a local copy of composer and use it to install the
latest [drush][link-drush] version locally for the project. There is the option
to use a globally installed drush.
[See configuration options][link-config-config].

There is no support for [drupalconsole][link-drupalconsole] for Drupal 8 (yet).
