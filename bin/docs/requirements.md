# Requirements
This skeleton requires a working bash environment. This comes standard with
Linux distributions and Mac OSX.

On top of that it requires you to have a working Apache, Mysql & PHP
environment, see [minimal requirements to run Drupal][link-drupal-requirements].

You also need to have [drush][link-drush] installed. There is no support for
[drupalconsole][link-drupalconsole] for Drupal 8 (yet).
