  This script has only one (optional) argument: the name for the package without
  the extension. Example: "my_site_v1.0" will become "my_site_v1.0.tar.gz".
  If no package name is given, an unique name will be created using the
  site_name as defined in the config file and the date-time stamp when the
  package was created.
