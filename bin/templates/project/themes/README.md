# Project themes
Put custom themes in this directory.

Each subdirectory in this directory will be symlinked to the
`web/sites/all/themes` directory during install & upgrade. Or copied into
`build/web/sites/all/themes` during build.

> **Tip** : Create a subdirectory to put custom themes in (eg. `custom`).
