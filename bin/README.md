# drupal-skeleton

[![Author][icon-author]][link-author]
[![License : MIT][icon-license]][link-license]

Set of bash scripts and configuration files to install, reset, upgrade, backup,
restore and build a Drupal project without the need to have Core and Contributed
code in the repository.

* [See the documentation about the Drupal Skeleton][link-docs].



## 6 commands
The skeleton provides 6 commands to run the site locally.

Each command has a help section that explains the options for it. View the help
by running the command with the `-h` switch.

Example:

```Shell
$ bin/install -h
```


### bin/install
The `bin/install` command will download Core & Contributed (modules, themes &
libraries) as defined in the make file(s), and will install the website with
the settings in the config/config.sh file.

When the installation is finished, a browser will be opened and you will be
logged in as platform administrator (user 1).

If there is already a working installation, a backup of it will be taken.

```Shell
$ bin/install
```

[More information about this command][link-command-install].


### bin/reset
The `bin/reset` command will do the same as install without downloading the Core
and Contributed projects. Use this to reset an already installed website to its
fresh-install state.

A backup will be taken before the reset is run.

The `sites/default/settings.php` file, the `sites/default/files` directory and
the database will be removed before the site is reinstalled.

```bash
$ bin/reset
```

[More information about this command][link-command-reset].


### bin/upgrade
The `bin/upgrade` command will download Core & Contributed code based on the
make files and run the update-db command. Use this to update core and
contributed to their latest version or to apply a patch.

A backup will be taken before the reset is run.

The existing settings.php, files directory and database will be kept.

```bash
$ bin/upgrade
```

[More information about this command][link-command-upgrade].


### bin/build
The `bin/build` command will create a deployment package (code) in the `/build`
directory.

```bash
$ bin/build
```

[More information about this command][link-command-build].


### bin/backup
The `bin/backup` command will take a backup of the web directory and the
database. The backup will be stored in the `backup` directory.

You can limit the backup to just the web or files directory or just the database
by passing them as arguments.

```bash
$ bin/backup
```

[More information about this command][link-command-backup].


### bin/restore
The `bin/restore` command will list the available backups from the `backup`
directory and let you choose which one to restore. It will restore the `/web`
directory and the database.

If there is a working environment: a backup of it will be created before the
restore is run.

```bash
$ bin/restore
```

[More information about this command][link-command-restore].


## Alter commands by implementing hooks
Each command has a set of steps it runs trough. All the code related to those
steps are located in the `bin` and `bin/src` directories. This code should not
be altered/hacked.

The drupal-skeleton provides hooks that are called before and after each step so
extra scripts can be added and run.

The hooks can be implemented only for specific environments by adding the
environment name as postfix to the hook.

See [hooks documentation][link-hooks].
