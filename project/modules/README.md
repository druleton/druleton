# Project modules
Put custom modules in this directory.

Each subdirectory in this directory will be symlinked to the
`web/sites/all/modules` directory during install & upgrade. Or copied into
`build/web/sites/all/modules` during build.

> **Tip** : Create a subdirectory to put custom modules in (eg. `custom`,
`features`, ...).
